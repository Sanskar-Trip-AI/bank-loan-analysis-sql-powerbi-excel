## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to perform an end-to-end analysis of loan data from a financial institution. The analysis covers loan disbursement trends, borrower profiles, interest rates, and repayment performance. Results are visualized in Power BI to provide actionable insights for risk assessment and business decision-making.

## Objective
- To analyze overall loan performance and borrower behavior.
- To classify loans into 'Good' and 'Bad' categories based on repayment.
- To study relationships between interest rate, loan amount, and income.
- To visualize insights that help stakeholders improve lending strategies.

## Dataset Description
- **Source:** Open-source bank loan dataset (approx. 38,000 records, 24‚Äì25 columns)
- **Key Columns:** loan_id, purpose, funded_amount, interest_rate, dti, annual_income, loan_status, issue_date
- **Cleaning & Processing:** Missing value handling, date extraction, data type conversions


## Tools & Technologies Used
- **SQL:** Data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation
- **Power BI:** Interactive dashboards and KPIs
- **Excel:** Exploratory analysis and data validation

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Total Loan Applications
- Total Funded Amount
- Total Amount Received
- Average Interest Rate
- Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)
- % of Good Loans vs. Bad Loans


## üìä Dashboards Overview

The project includes three interactive Power BI dashboards ‚Äî **Summary**, **Overview**, and **Details** ‚Äî designed to analyze and visualize loan performance and borrower data effectively.
